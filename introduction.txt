Brief Introduction About Myself

My name is Wokama Gabriel Ejike, a native of Rundele in Emouha LGA, Rivers State, Nigeria. I am 6" tall, slim,  fair skinned, and a Christain by religion. 
I love playing football, for me it's more than a hobby, it's a lifestyle and it makes me fulfilled in some way.
Other things which I love doing are Teaching, rhyming and working out.

I am currently a learner at ALX, having enrolled in the ALX PATHWAY programme last year while working a 9-5 job is one of the toughest decisions I have ever made.
Because I thought at first it wont be possible with the nature of my job. Even though it seems likely to be impossible given the amount of courses for this term.
I have decided that I must graduate having finished term one. I enrolled in the pathway programme not just because of the sholarship opportunity but chiefly to improve my personal Brand.
I believe with this course I will achieve that as well as scholarship.
