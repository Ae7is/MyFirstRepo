I have learnt how to use git commands in both Lcal. GitBash and VSCode terminals. Commands such as: git add, git add . , git diff, 
git log, git commit -m, git status, git pull origin, git push origin main. I have also learnt how to create, clone, and for Repositories.
As well creating branches, creating and editing files, commiting changes, and creating PRs (Pull requests).
